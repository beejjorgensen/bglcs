# Growth Mindset

This is a tough one for me, personally. I don't like failing at things,
even if no one can see me doing it, and especially when people do. It
knots my stomach and then I say all kinds of bad things to myself that I
wouldn't ever say to anyone else.

And I do this even though I know it's a losing game and it contradicts
the exact advice I give in this section.

What's better?

Psychologist [flw[Carol Dweck|Mindset#Fixed_and_growth_mindset]]
popularized the term *growth mindset*.

The gist of it is:

* You can expand your skills with effort
* Embrace lifelong learning
* Challenges are growth opportunities
* Learn from criticism and failure
* Never give up, never surrender![^707b]

[^707b]: Yes, I'm a _Galaxy Quest_ fan.

That kind of thing.

It's the opposite of what I tend to do when I lose my bazillionth game
of [flw[Go|Go_(game)]]. How could I have made so many stupid mistakes?
I'll never be good at this!

But that's what Dweck would refer to as a "fixed" mindset. It's my
mistaken belief that no matter how much I play the game, I'm up against
my own intrinsic limitations that I'll never get past no matter if I
study for 500,000 hours!

And when I put it that way, it's kinda silly. No one can spend 500,000
hours doing *anything* without getting better at it.

So what about 50,000 hours? 500 hours? 50 hours? 5 hours?

Come to think of it, it seems like any amount of practice is going to be
an improvement.

Even when you're completely stuck, you're still exploring avenues. Even
if they turn out to be dead-ends, you've at least learned that they are!

experience.

I think this is one of the main attributes of anyone who grows to excel
at anything. (How's that for a generalization?) Instructors would do
well to point this out to students.

Who is going to get farther, the person who gives up after a failure, or
the person who fails and fails and fails and fails and keeps getting up,
dusting themselves off, and trying again?

This is what separates the exceptional devs from the unremarkable devs.
The exceptional devs have had their asses _kicked_ over and over and
over, and _they kept attacking_ and attacking and attacking until they
solved the problem. And they learned something from every single
failure.

And something that's related here that students might not realize: your
instructors failed and failed and failed and failed, too! Sure, they can
live-code the linked list delete in class and have it work on the first
try... except that wasn't the first try, was it? It was, like, the 100th
time they've done it. You code up a linked list delete from scratch 100
times and you'll be getting it right on the first try, too!

Instructors might be doing things that seem to be amazing, and this
might make you think that you'll never be that good because this stuff
seems to come so naturally to them and it's so _impossible_ for you.
What magical skill were they endowed with in the womb that you will
never have? (Hear that fixed mindset talking?) 

But here's the secret: there's no difference between you and your
instructors other than the number of failures you've had. You'll need to
fail a lot more to get as good as they are!

Very, very few people are "natural" coders. 99.999% of the rest of us
have to work really hard to learn this stuff.

## You Gotta Want It

When I was thinking about getting a PhD (I didn't), my adviser advised
that, "You gotta want it." The implication was that it was so much work
to get a PhD that I had to have enough drive to put in the time.

And I think this is good advice in general about learning Computer
Science.

There's so much really hard stuff to figure out, you have to have enough
drive to do it. It's not easy. At all.

I like to use the example of me being an accountant. I know I'm smart
enough to do it (math minor!) but I also know I *hate* it. My old
roommate became an accountant and I had the misfortune of cracking open
one of her study guide books. Never again will I make that mistake.

My brain just shuts down the minute people start talking about it.
Imagine something that bores you to tears that you hate. Now imagine
spending four years studying it in excruciating detail.

Speaking for myself and projecting broadly, I think it's a lot harder to
motivate to put in the work to do something you hate.

I caught a lot of flak on Hacker News for this assertion a while ago.
Several people commented that they hated programming and still managed
to have a career at it.

First, that's a... bummer. But secondly, I still argue that people
who love computer science had an easier time getting their degree than
people who hated it.

And the people who seem to be "naturals" are the ones who *really* love
it. They think about computer science *all the time* (because who
wouldn't?) and, as such, get a lot of practice in. Rather a lot more
than the people who hate it tend to.

So, while it's clearly possible to have a career in a lucrative field
you dislike, it's (a) going to be harder for you than for people who
like it and (b) maybe you should consider a field that you do like?

You gotta want it. Do you want it enough to go through the tremendous
amount of effort it takes to learn it? Maybe you hate programming, but
you want the money enough. Maybe you don't care about the money, but you
want to program every second of the day.

Just make sure you have the drive to make it happen.

## It's Not Easy

Computer Science is *hard*. Like really hard. If you're used to things
being relatively easy because you were the smart one in class, it might
be a shocker to get to some of these topics and get your ass handed to
you.

But it's this hard for everyone. You're not blessed with a special lack
of ability to learn computer science. You just have to keep hammering
away just like everyone else.

You wouldn't doubt that juggling 11 balls at once is difficult for
everyone, would you? [fl[And yet, people
