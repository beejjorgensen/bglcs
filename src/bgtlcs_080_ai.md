# Use of AI

As of this writing in 2025, AI is the new hotness[^0D45]. Everyone is
using it, and no one can stop talking about it.

[^0D45]: Unlike the expression "new hotness", which is now tired.
    "Tired" is also tired, but that's self-referential so I think it has
    bottomed out.

When you read this, I want you to know that I, the author, thought
[fl[Yahoo!|https://www.yahoo.com/]] was a dumb idea when it first
launched. I kinda still do think it was, but it made a bazillion dollars
since then, so I was wrong. At least capitalistically.

One thing old devs have been hearing their entire careers is that we're
on the verge of the "no code" revolution, and that this tool or that
tool will finally put coders out of a job because everyone everywhere
will be able to produce software.

Every one of these predictions has something in common in that they were
all fantastically wrong.

But things are only wrong until they aren't, and LLMs like ChatGPT are
definitely novel beasts that don't play by the previous rules.

And LLMs are showing incredibly coding expertise. I am perpetually
amazed by what they can do. But can they do it all?

I have a thought experiment for you. Let's say there's an AI so good
that I can tell it, "AI, design and implement a corporation that will
crush all my competitors and make me the richest person on Earth," and
it will actually successfully do it.

But the catch is that everyone has access to the same AI and they can
all make the same request. Where does that land us? We're back to square
one where we're on equal footing.

As a capitalist, though, I don't like equal footing. I want to get an
edge on my competition. So I start thinking, "What can we do that's
slightly different than what the AI is telling my competition?"

And just like that, humans are back in the game!

I think that trend's going to continue, maybe forever.

What will happen, I predict, is that the easy boilerplate jobs that
exist now will experience a massive tightening. AI can solve lots of
those easy problems, and you don't need a big team of engineers behind
them. The more novel problems will still need a lot of human work.

But maybe not as much work as before. AI can help in a variety of ways,
outlined above, so it helps speed things up.

Going back in time, consider when most programs were written in
[flw[assembly language|Assembly_language]] and it took a lot of
specialized knowledge to get these error-prone programs written. And
then compilers became popular and now no one[^F913] writes in assembly
any longer; those jobs are toast, destroyed by the faster, easier coding
that compilers afford.

[^F913]: Well, a few people do. You should try it for fun. It's something
    else.

In short, I think we're going to keep pushing it, and AI will become a
very useful tool, but only with humans at the helm.

And yes, it's pretty terrifying to think that I might be wrong. But I
think if AI is good enough to take over all the programming jobs, then
it's also good enough to take over basically all jobs, and our global
economic system will implode and I guess it's all back to farming and
ranching.

Just wanted to end on an upbeat note. TODO
