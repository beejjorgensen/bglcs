# Hacks for Learning

There are a number of tips and tricks for maximizing your speed of
durable learning. Devs know these help, and yet we stubbornly ignore
them all the time.

But just in case you want to get faster at learning, here are a few
things that work for some people. No guarantees; everyone's different,
and you might have your own path that works better.

> electronica, or metal. Do what works for you.

## Flow

[flw[_Flow_|Flow_(psychology)]] is a mental state you get in where
you're focused and ideas are connecting freely. There are no
interruptions.

Programmers like to get in flow for maximum productivity.

Here are the characteristics of that state stolen directly from
Wikipedia:

1. Intense and focused concentration on the present moment
2. Merging of action and awareness
3. A loss of reflective self-consciousness
4. A sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
5. A distortion of temporal experience, as one's subjective experience
   of time is altered
6. Experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding

You've probably already experienced this in some aspect of your life.
Keep in mind that it can be very beneficial for programmers.

## Reading Ahead

I know when I was a student, if something was due on Sunday, I'd
commonly read about it for the first time on Sunday. Anyone else do
that? Yeah.

But here's another idea: read the assignment as soon as you get it.
Maybe you don't know enough yet for it to make sense, but that's okay.
Just read it, maybe not even that closely.

And another idea: read the assignment when you've done some of the other
reading and lecture, but days before you plan to start working on it.
Again, just read it, not worrying about solving it. Maybe read it right
away **and** partway through the week!

What this does is prime your brain with the information. You won't
retain it or understand it all, but your brain will start chewing on it
in the background and will make the project easier to tackle when you
finally get around to it at 9 PM Sunday night.

And when you do start the four-stage problem solving process, the
material will seem less foreign and more approachable.

A powerful variant of this is to complete the Understanding phase early.
Don't need to Plan or Code It Up.

## The 30 Minute Rule

If you've been stuck for 30 minutes and you've **really** tried to
attack the problem from a variety of directions and have still come up
dry, it's time to reach out for help.

Yes, you can go longer than 30 minutes without help (we all do), but 30
minutes is a good balance between working hard and bring productive with
the limited time you have for schoolwork.

Here's a story. One of my favorite books for learning about programming
is called [flw[_The Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs_|Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs]], or SICP
for short. (I particularly like the Scheme version—really helps you
learn recursion.)

The programming problems in that book can be really challenging. But I
gave myself a six hour time limit per problem. (I didn't do all six in a
row, usually.) After the time was up, I looked at the answer.

And here's what that does and why it's important. While you work hard on
a problem, you're busy building a mental framework around it, trying to
support it. And if you get the answer, great! But even if you don't,
*you've still built that framework*.

So when you give up after your time limit, very often the solution you
read fits neatly into the framework you've already built. It's just a
tiny step from your framework to the solution, and it's *way* easier to
take that little step to the solution than to try to
[flw[grok|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok#In_computer_programmer_culture]]
the entire thing.

Contrast that to when you just look up the answer immediately without
building the framework. The solution has nowhere to "sit" in your brain,
and doesn't connect to anything else.

*The struggle is vital!* Don't skip the struggle! But at the same time,
don't keep it up forever. When you timeout, ask for help from a peer, a
tutor, an instructor, or (if allowed) an AI.

## No Copy-Paste Coding

You need to solve a problem, and look right there on the Intertubes!
There's a solution! Time to break out the ol' `CTRL-c`/`CTRL-v` skills!

It used to be that people found this solution on the programming site
[fl[Stack Overflow|https://stackoverflow.com/]]. And commonly still do.
But nowadays they tend to punt to some AI.

*Beginning developers should not do this.* Remember the main goal:
develop excellent problem-solving skills. Copy-paste coding does
**nothing** to further this goal.

One exception to this rule is if you already struggled with the problem
for some time, as mentioned in the _30 Minute Rule_ section, above. But
even then, you **must** understand the code you're copying 100%
completely before using it.

## Go for a Walk

Yes, I'm serious. You're stuck, and nothing seems to be working, and no
additional plans of attack are coming to mind. What do you do?

Go for a walk.

As you try different approaches to a problem, it's like you're leaving
ruts behind in the road, and your brain tends to focus on the existing
ruts rather than trying something new. You're locked in on the
approaches you've tried but around working. "If only I could just tweak
this one thing that almost works..." but you're not seeing how.

Stand up and stroll. Maybe you're at work and this just means you're
making laps in the hallway. Or maybe you can go outside on a balcony,
out front, or on the roof.

This frees your mind to get out of those ruts and explore new
approaches.

There have been times (working remote) where I've decided to go for a
walk and have gotten two steps out the front door when a new approach to
the problem has occurred to me.
