Boy, did you come to the wrong place! What you have here is a book
written by a programmer with 20 years of industry experience who has
been teaching computer science since 2017.

And I have opinions about how to teach and learn computer science!

Now, let's get this right out of the way: you might completely disagree
with my stance(s). And I'm okay with that.

But with my meager experience, I have had the opportunity to see
students make a variety of mistakes. And hopefully I can head some of
these off at the pass for a number of readers.

Students and teachers, alike: if you find something you disagree with,
please don't hesitate to let me know so I can improve the guide.

Disclaimer: like with all the guides I write, I'm not the master of the
subject. And with a squishy topic like teaching and learning, I'm even
less so. And full disclosure: I only have a BS and MS in CS.

But give it a read and take what's useful and leave the rest for the
[flw[boids|Boids]].

Note that this is not a programming guide, _per se_. This is stepping
back a meta level and talking about things that make you a better
developer in general.

## Audience

Undergrad students just getting into programming are the people I had in
mind while writing this. So give-or-take a bit around that target
audience. People in high school or just looking to learn how to program
are also probably out there in the audience, as well.

## Email Policy

I'm generally available to help out with email questions so feel free to
write in, but I can't guarantee a response. I lead a pretty busy life
and there are times when I just can't answer a question you have. When
that's the case, I usually just delete the message. It's nothing
personal; I just won't ever have the time to give the detailed answer
you require.

As a rule, the more complex the question, the less likely I am to
respond. If you can narrow down your question before mailing it and be
sure to include any pertinent information (like platform, compiler,
error messages you're getting, and anything else you think might help me
troubleshoot), you're much more likely to get a response.

If you don't get a response, hack on it some more, try to find the
answer, and if it's still elusive, then write me again with the
information you've found and hopefully it will be enough for me to help
out.

Now that I've badgered you about how to write and not write me, I'd just
like to let you know that I _fully_ appreciate all the praise the guide
has received over the years. It's a real morale boost, and it gladdens
me to hear that it is being used for good! `:-)` Thank you!

## Dedication

The hardest things about writing these guides are:

* Learning the material in enough detail to be able to explain it
* Figuring out the best way to explain it clearly, a seemingly-endless
  iterative process
* Putting myself out there as a so-called _authority_, when really
  I'm just a regular human trying to make sense of it all, just like
  everyone else
* Keeping at it when so many other things draw my attention

A lot of people have helped me through this process, and I want to
acknowledge those who have made this book possible.

* Everyone on the Internet who decided to help share their knowledge in
  one form or another. The free sharing of instructive information is
  what makes the Internet the great place that it is.
* Everyone who submitted corrections and pull-requests on everything
  from misleading instructions to typos.

Thank you! ♥
